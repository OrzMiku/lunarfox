**LunarFox** is a modern Minecraft modpack designed to provide players with a smooth and feature-rich gaming experience through a series of carefully selected and pre-configured mods. It integrates mainstream performance optimization mods, a complete set of OptiFine alternatives, and numerous quality-of-life (QoL) mods that improve gameplay convenience.

Whether you're looking for higher frame rates, want to use shaders and HD resource packs, or need more professional in-game tools, LunarFox provides an out-of-the-box solution.

## üì¶ Core Features

### üöÄ Comprehensive Performance Optimization

The modpack optimizes the game on multiple levels by integrating several industry-recognized performance mods to achieve higher frame rates and more stable performance.

- **Rendering Engine**: Uses **Sodium** as the core rendering engine to significantly increase FPS.
- **Memory Management**: Mods like **FerriteCore** effectively reduce the game's memory usage.
- **Game Logic & Chunk Performance**: **Lithium** and **C2ME** are responsible for optimizing game ticks and chunk loading to reduce stutter.
- **Entity & Block Culling**: **EntityCulling** and other mods prevent rendering unnecessary objects outside your field of view.
- And more...

### ‚ú® Complete Visual Enhancements (OptiFine Alternatives)

LunarFox includes a full suite of mods to replicate OptiFine's visual enhancement features, allowing you to enjoy a modern visual experience without installing OptiFine.

- **Shader Support**: Load your favorite OptiFine shader packs with **Iris Shaders**.
- **Resource Pack Extensions**: Supports advanced resource pack features like connected textures (**Continuity**), custom item textures (**CIT Resewn**), and custom entity models (**EMF**).
- **Dynamic Lighting**: **LambDynamicLights** provides dynamic lighting effects for glowing items and entities.
- **Custom Skies**: **FabricSkyBoxes** allows resource packs to add custom sky rendering.
- And more...

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Quality of Life (QoL) Mods

To make gameplay more convenient and information more intuitive, LunarFox includes a large number of popular QoL mods.

- **Mapping & Navigation**: **Xaero's Minimap** and **World Map** provide powerful minimap and world map functionality.
- **Inventory Management**: **Inventory Profiles Next** and **Mouse Tweaks** offer powerful inventory sorting and item manipulation features.
- **Information Display**: **Jade** displays information about blocks and entities at your crosshair, while **BetterF3** provides a cleaner debug screen.
- **Technical Tools**: Built-in tools like **Litematica**, **Tweakeroo**, and **MiniHUD** for redstone engineers and builders.
- And more...

## üéÆ Tips

- When using the Litematica mod, you may need to change its hotkeys or the `Open World Map` hotkey to avoid conflicts.
- Players with high-resolution screens can press `.` to open the rendering resolution settings. For example, 2K screens can set the scaling factor to 0.75 to reduce the resolution to 1080p and improve frame rate.
