## ü¶ä LunarFox

LunarFox is a performance modpack with quality of life mods and OptiFine alternatives. This modpack includes some out-of-the-box mod configurations and good performance settings.

## üì¶ Features

### OptiFine Alternatives

LunarFox uses a series of mods to replace OptiFine's functionality. For a detailed list, please refer to the Fabric Wiki: [OptiFine Alternatives](https://wiki.fabricmc.net/zh_cn:community:optifine_alternatives). If you don't want to install these mods manually, you can use the LunarFox modpack directly.

### Performance Optimization

Some OptiFine alternative mods focus on performance optimization, improving game performance, reducing lag, and increasing frame rates. The modpack also includes other performance-enhancing mods and has pre-configured performance options.

### Quality of Life (QoL) Mods

> Quality of Life (QoL) mods aim to improve the gaming experience rather than add content. They usually provide better user interfaces, controls, feedback, etc.

The modpack includes many QoL mods such as map mods, item managers, and inventory organizers. For redstone and technical players, it also includes the Masa mod suite and some commonly used mods.

## üéÆ Tips

- When using the Litematic mod, you need to change it's hotkey or the `Open World Map` hotkey.
